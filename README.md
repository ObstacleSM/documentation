# ManiaScript documentation

The goal of this book is to provide better documentation for ManiaScript.

ManiaScript is a scripting language made by Nadeo for their games \(TrackMania, ShootMania, and the upcoming QuestMania\).

This language is easy to use if you already have some programming knowledge and it allows you to create your own game modes or map editor plugin.
