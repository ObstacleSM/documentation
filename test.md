# Syntax Basics

## Basic types

There are 9 different types in ManiaScript: `Void`, `Integer`, `Real`, `Boolean`, `Text`, `Vec2`, `Vec3`,`Int3` and `Ident`.

| Void |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  |  |
|  |  |

### 

`Void` is a type that means empty. You cannot create variables of that type, it is used to declare functions that returns nothing.

### Integer

An `Integer` variable is an integer number \($$\mathbb{Z}$$ in mathematics\) between $$-2147483648$$ \($$-2^{31}$$\) and $$2147483647$$\($$2^{31}-1$$\).

### Real

A `Real` variable is a real number \($$\mathbb{R}$$ in mathematics\). It can represents values much higher than Integer.

### Boolean

A `Boolean` variable can be either `True` or `False`.

### Text

`Text` represents a string of characters.

### Vec2

`Vec2` is a two dimensional vector \($$\mathbb{R^2}$$ in mathematics\). The two values can be accessed with `X` and `Y` respectively.

### Vec3

`Vec3` is a three dimensional vector \($$\mathbb{R^3}$$ in mathematics\). The third value can be accessed with the `Z` property.

### Ident

`Ident` is the type of an Id. Every class in ManiaScript has a unique `Id` property that can be used to identify it.
